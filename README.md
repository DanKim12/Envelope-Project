# Envelope-Project
This project is about a game with 100 envelopes and different strategies. Each envelope has a hidden amount of money, and the player uses a strategy to decide when to stop and choose an envelope.
After that, we made a tournament system. Different types of tournaments were added:

DeathMatch – two players, first to X wins.
Round Robin – all strategies play against each other and get points.
Elimination – loser is out, winner continues.
League – all strategies play two times against each other, like a full season.
Championship – group stage and then playoffs.

Finally, we ran many simulations (1000+ games) to compare the strategies. The results are saved in CSV files, and the README shows UML diagrams.
The goal of the work is to test how different strategies perform in the envelope game and to practice object-oriented programming, inheritance, and tournament management.
